## A Team Based Project Evaluation  Exercise

### Instructions

This activity is intended to be a sprint-like team effort in class.
The repository contains a file named `evaluation_template.md` and a list of 
projects in a file named `sample_projects.md`.
The `evaluation_template.md` file is a questionnaire to be answered for the
project that the team has selected. Iyt is restricted to questions about the
level of activity in the project.

The first step is to fill in the project name and the team members at the top
of the form.

As a team activity, it is a good git exercise to work on the document simultaneously but on different questions
and then have to resolve the inevitable merge conflicts that will ensue.

Remember to somplete the summary at the bottom of the page. It should be
your overall assessment of how active the project is.
