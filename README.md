## A Team Based Project Evaluation  Exercise

### Instructions

This activity is intended to be a sprint-like team effort in class.
The repository contains a file named ``evaluation_template.md`` and a list of 
projects in a file named `sample_projects.md`.
The ``evaluation_template.md`` file is a questionnaire to be answered for the
project that the team has selected. Iyt is restricted to questions about the
level of activity in the project.

1. Everyone should choose a project from the list of projects in the ``sample_projects.md`` file.

2. Go to the class organization's [wiki page for project selection](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki/wiki/Project-Choices)
and add your GitHub name or real name if you want (remember this is a public wiki)
on the line next to the project.

3. When everyone has done this, projects with no names will be removed and
if projects have just 1 or 2 people those people will have to choose a different
project. Minimum team size is three people.

4. Once teams are formed, a copy of this repository will be created on GitHub
for the team, and each team member will have write access to it. The repository
names will be determined in class. 

5. Each team will begin answering the questions about the 
project's activity level in the ``evaluation_template.md`` file.

6. The team can divide the work however it chooses. 

7. The first step in completing the form is to fill in the project name and the team members at the top
of the form.

8. As a team activity, it is a good git exercise to work on the document simultaneously but on different questions
and then have to resolve the inevitable merge conflicts that will ensue.
This might require each team member to clone the repo and work locally and push
back up after.

9. Remember to complete the summary at the bottom of the page. It should be
your overall assessment of how active the project is.
