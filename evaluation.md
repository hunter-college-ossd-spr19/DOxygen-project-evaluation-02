### Summary

Overall, because of the size and user base of this project, DOxygen is a very active open source project. However, this project is not one I would choose to participate in because communication amoung users and contributors seems limited, and there are few resources for first time contributors. That said, the project is well organized, and for someone who uses DOxygen regularly and is comfortable contributing to open source software this could be a great way to contribute to a project they are passionate about.
